This includes regional news sources which simply repost or rehost the content from another regional news source. \\n\\n**2) No editorializing titles on news submissions.** If you are submitting a link, best to use the original title that exists at the time of posting. Do not add or alter the title as it will see your post removed and repeated offenders banned.\\n\\n**3) Personal Attacks.** This one is quite simple. Feel free to attack the idea but do not attack the person.\\n\\n**4) Being Uncivil.** This is another quite simple one. If all you have left is to call someone a name or use inappropriate language, you are out of arguments and whatever you are arguing you have lost.\\n\\n**5) Do not bring drama here from other subs.** If you have an issue with another sub, /r/Ontario is not the place to grieve such issues. Those who do will be warned and if it happens often you may be looking at a ban.\\n\\n**6) Posting personal information (Doxxing).** You are not allowed (both by reddit and our subs rules) to post any personal information here to this sub. This is a very strict rule with no intermediate bans. If the information is publicly available (say a businesses address and phone number) or is a public official (their constituent office) then it is not considered doxxing. If the information is reported in multiple news sources, often it is not going to be considered doxxing if you post those news stories. If you are unsure if what you want to post is doxxing, feel free to send a modmail asking and we will let you know.\\n\\n**7) Posts inciting witch hunts are strictly forbidden.** This one is fairly simple. You are not allowed to use /r/Ontario as a place to organize a witch hunt against anyone or any organisation.\\n\\n**8) Unrelated to Ontario.** If what you are posting does not affect Ontario or the people of Ontario in some way, it may be considered off topic and removed as being unrelated to /r/Ontario.\\n\\n**9) Inciting or Advocating for Violence.** This is another dual reddit/subreddit rule. You are not allowed to advocate for violence of any kind against anyone for any reason. This is a rule we follow as strictly as possible. First time is the last time. These are the bans we hand out most frequently.\\n\\n**10) Hate Speech.** Another really simple one. We do not allow hate speech of any kind. If you need to know if something you are about to post is hate speech, it probably is.\\n\\n**11) Trolling.** This can be a more difficult one to judge but if you feel a user is not attempting to discuss something in good faith or is an account that simply exists only to troll, please report it so we can take a look and deal with it if necessary.\\n\\n**12) Attacking fellow users.** You are not allowed to attack your fellow users for any reason. Remember, attack the idea not the person.\\n\\n**13) Attack ads.** You are not allowed to post attack ads of any kind. If you come across what you feel is an attack ad, report it and the mod team will make a call.\\n\\n**14) No unsourced posters.** If you are making a \"poster\" (picture type submission) and you are putting any information of said poster, you are required to cite that information in the comments. Failing to do so will result in post removal and up to removal from the sub.\\n\\n_______________________\\n\\n##Reddit Rules Not Covered By Our Sub Rules\\n\\n**No Illegal Content** - If it is law breaking behaviour, then it is banned from reddit. \\n\\n**No involuntary pornography** - Generally we do not allow porn on the sub as there are better subs for it however it is against reddit rules to post involuntary pornography.\\n\\n**No sexual or suggestive content involving minors** - This is the most vile content possible and it has no place on reddit. This is not something that should even exist for someone to post. \\n\\n**Impersonates another person** - You are not allowed to use reddit to impersonate another person. \\n\\nAny of these rules are broken we not only ban but we report to admins and follow up.   \\n\\n_______________________\\n\\nOn a final note, I want to cover something specific that we have seen occurring recently. DO NOT POST ANY INFORMATION ABOUT VANDALIZING THOSE GAS PUMP STICKERS. This can result in more than simple mischief charges. Gas pumps are a federally regulated thing and defacing information on them could very well end up with more than simple mischief charges. \\n\\nYou are free to attack the idea of the stickers, discuss ways of getting information out to people about climate change at its effects or any other type of information you want, however if you advocate for vandalizing stickers on the gas pump, you post will be removed and we will issue warnings follow by bans.',\n",
